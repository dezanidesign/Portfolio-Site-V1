# Portfolio-Site-V1
My first attempt at coding a responsive portfolio site using vanilla HTML &amp; CSS.

For this website I wanted to have fun with learning and trying out the new things I'd learnt on the course and play around with interesting CSS.

I''m happy with the site, unfortuntately I ran out of time but I'll be revisiting in the future. For example I still need to add some accesbility like <section> <aside> etc. Also I wanted to add a burger menu for the mobile version and generally align many of the elements up.
  
  However despite not getting everything I wanted done I'm still very pleased with the site.
  
  Because I don't have much web portfolio work yet I used my motion graphics showreel as the primary portfolio piece.
